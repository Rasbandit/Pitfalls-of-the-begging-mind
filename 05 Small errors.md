## "Small" errors

Students continue to feel this dissonance widening because it demands and is required that everything be spelt perfectly or suffer the consequences of instant failure. This is demoralizing to a new programmer because we are fighting some deeply carved habits and shortcuts our brain has made over the years (often without even realizing we made those short cuts!) We have learned to read whole words, not read a collection of individual letters and sound it out and remember the meaning. We have amazing pattern recognition and the ability to fill in the blanks, so if two letters are swapped in a word, the human brain has trained itself to quickly read over the word and ignore “small” issues so that we can continue and not get hung up. The computer has no such filter, if the word is “spelt wrong” then it is wrong and does not exist. Notice I put “spelt wrong” in quotes above, this implies the computer has an understanding of the idea of “close to” or even the concept of “spelling.” For us there is a small difference between “animal” and “anamal”, however the computer has no such mechanism and there is no connection between those two and are 100% different in every way. You must learn to destroy your brain’s autocomplete functionality by learning to read “letter by letter” not “word by word” because as the words have no meaning the computer, they have values associated to the variable name. Because of this if you are going to keep any sense of sanity when learning to program you have to learn to remove the phrase, “small error” from your phraseology. “Small errors” paint this mental picture that you can’t even do the simple things like spelling or typing, skill you should have mastered in grade school.These errors are causing such a “Big deal” that you must be bad at coding. That is so far from reality and is a response founded in emotion, not logic. In the cold hard word of computers if you ask is x is equal to y, there is no, “its not but its close”, you will get either a no or yes. There are no shades of grey, only 0 or 1, is and is not.. You must not look at problems in your code with the lense of a human gauging it by size, that can only do one thing, make you feel inadequate or that you are a fraud. I can promise you  even senior programmers make these “small errors,” the only difference between them and you, is they have mastered reading “letter by letter” and have practiced reading the error messages.

To tie this back to the the cover or layer analogy the shell is the words we choose to give meaning to the values, but the computer looks only at the lifeless values behind the names we choose and makes no meaningful connection between the two. There is the mind of the computer that is lifeless and cold,  and our mind that is full of feeling, bias and connection. I often hear students say things like, “it should know,” or “why doesn’t it know” and the problem is those biases literally can’t exist in programming. Perhaps the most damning mindset that carries over to programming is “this should work!” That phrase is filled with so much emotion and ends up not being founded in reality at all. A computer will only follow your instructions so if you are convinced that it should work, the real problem that you have run into is that you lack the communication skills/tools to talk with the computer and establish common ground. We often come to students who are struggling with their code and are at their wits end and I come over and see there hasn’t been any attempt to clarify their communication. Instead what they try is continually rephrasing the question or instructions without a thought of “how can I check how the computer interprets this?” So you must fill both the role of question asker and the clarifier at the same time. All you know is your communication failed so it falls to you to also clarify your own question, often without a real understanding of why your communication was poor. We have lots of tools to clarify our communication but the approach to doing so is so new that it is more rare than common for people to even attempt to truly clarify, often because they are stuck in the mindset of assumptions.
