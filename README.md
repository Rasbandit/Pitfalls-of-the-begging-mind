# Pitfalls of the Beginning Mind

## Preface

This is a work in progress, but what I am attempting to construct is what I am calling, coding philosophy. I believe philosophy is an appropriate way to describe what I am attempting to build here as what philosophy is, is a way if thinking. A way to think about  the world. Many nations and languages have their own philosophy or way of thinking through problems or communicating and I want to try and bridge that gap between a western philosophy, and a coding philosophy. To show new people who want to get into coding the pitfalls you will inevitable run into. I have not found that really anyone takes the time to explain what programmatic thinking is and the foundations of what that looks like. Feedback and your opinions would be very appreciated.


### Additional topics to flush out
