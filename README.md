# Pitfalls of the Beginning Mind

## Preface

This is a work in progress, but what I am attempting to construct is what I am calling, coding philosophy. I believe philosophy is an appropriate way to describe what I am attempting to build here as what philosophy is, is a way if thinking. A way to think about  the world. Many nations and languages have their own philosophy or way of thinking through problems or communicating and I want to try and bridge that gap between a western philosophy, and a coding philosophy. To show new people who want to get into coding the pitfalls you will inevitable run into. I have not found that really anyone takes the time to explain what programmatic thinking is and the foundations of what that looks like. Feedback and your opinions would be very appreciated.


## Good Communication

A good communicator knows that if you are to have a real dialogue with someone who’s opinions that differ from their own the primary goal is to clarify definitions. Both will use the same word but neither of them have the same meaning. If this is not remedied early in the conversation then there is no way to make progress as they are actually both talking about completely different things, both without even realizing it. We run into the same issue when programming without using tools like console.log, this is essentially our way to saying, “I think X means this, what do you think it means?” The only difference here is that we don’t get to negotiate on the definition, you are always wrong, and the computer is always right. And you are forced into changing your definition to match the computers, always. If the computer says the value is not what you expect then it is your responsibility to change the value behind the variable to match what you expect it to be. Coding is the infinite loop of going through that process every few minutes and sometime every few seconds. You must constantly be asking the computer, not yourself, what does this actually mean? This ties back perfectly to the idea talked about above where we say the name of the value has no bearing on what the value actually is in reality. You must learn to always questions the assumptions you are making about the code, and even more challenging is to realize that you are even making assumptions about your code, or “the way you are communicating”

On the subject of assumptions another concept that is hard to wrap the brain around is learning to watch ourselves and the way we interact with the computer, or in other words, to make observations. Every single click you make needs to be observed and remembered. I have often seen students looking through some data that has a lot of nested data inside of it to navigate it requires multiple clicks to get to the data they want. The question I pose them is, “what is the immediate information we are working with?” and they will then click 3 times to that data they want, and then give that answer. They completely ignore that they even used the mouse to navigate through the data and are so focused on what they want,  instead of what they have. This is common and I am not trying to condemn anyone for this but I want to make the point that the average person also has not learned what it means to watch closely and observe their actions and results. They act with no concept of all the actions they performed and which of the many actions actually caused error, and because they don’t see what they did as 4  separate actions it becomes hard to isolate what is happening. Back on the subject of the “size” of an action gives the action more weight or meaning than others, and if an action is sufficiently “small” then it can have no bearing. “All I did was click those buttons!” There is this sub context that because I do so many clicks all day and the action is so commonplace how can you expect me to watch everything after every single click? The annoyance and frustration of this is even further compounded that the new student often does not even know what, “paying attention” or “observing” even looks like. There is so much new information being throw with so much new phrasing it feels impossible to get usable information or meaning from it.

### Additional topics to flush out

To learn coding it is a minimum requirement that a foundation of observation is in place but is never taught or addressed.

Yes, no and mu.

When would I need to use this? Answer, “when you need to use it”

Science is about experimentation, not “tricks”

Moving a value into a function can suddenly change its name

Idea of “resolving data”
