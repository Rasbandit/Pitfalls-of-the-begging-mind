# Scientific Methodd

## Intro

When you start learning to program it is something that feels so foreign and alien to the average person. It's hard to put your finger on what exactly feels so off about it or why it so hard to learn and make improvements on. I would like to talk about the pitfalls and misunderstandings about programing to try and help you bridge the gap from where you are now and where you want to be. You probably wont fully understand all of what this topic is going over the first time but if you reread this I am hoping you can pick up more and more as your understanding continues to grow.

First I want to talk about what Scientific really means. When you hear science, or a science experiment you may initially think about things like the TV show Bill Nye the Science guy. The whole premise of that show is to show you scientific experiments or things that relate to science. I would like to challenge that none of those things are even remotely scientific. To be considered a scientist is someone who makes observations about the world around them, and then performs experiments to test their observations. I left that intentionally vague and broad for a few reasons. You can take a scientific approach to literally any topic. The whole point of being scientific is to learn new things and to fix problems. Before I can really prove or show what I mean by this I want to first talk about what the steps of the scientific method are.

1: Make Observe
2: Form a Hypothesis
3: Construct a test to prove hypothesis
4: Run the experiment
5: Analyse the results
6: Form Conclusion

I want to break down each one of these steps and how exactly they apply to coding. But to help make the point about how important these steps are to life and problem solving and that they don't just apply to coding I will also talk about how these apply to fixing a car, just to keep with the theme from earlier. Again I want to stress that scientific method is not something just for "scientist" and I would argue it is more of a way of life and a pattern of thinking. By making this your formal practice of problem solving you will have the framework to approach any problem.

### Observation

The first step in the process can come up at any point while you are working. Making an observation can be as easy as noticing, that there is a problem with your project. In the world of cars you might notice or observe that your car make an odd sound while you are driving. By noticing something like that you have unknowingly started the scientific process but a lot of people will stop the process at this point and ignore what could be a greater problem. Or if you choose to engage in your observation you may not have experience at making specific acute observations. We said that your car is making noise, but when is it making noise? does it happen all the time? Only when you turn? only at high speeds? At this point it is going to be to your most benefit for you to hold off moving onto step two until you have done a thorough job making your observations.

In computer speak you the types of observations you could have made is that your code failed after you added in a new feature. But where exactly did it fail? Did it fail on load? when you moved the mouse over an element, or when you clicked something. Did it happen immediately or was there a delay? I will talk more about taking this process slowly in another section but you need to train yourself to notice exactly the order of events that happen. Often I see students perform 10 actions and they are unsure of what caused the issue because they are not asking themselves these kind of questions, or moving methodically through their application and watching the console for errors after every little thing.

You are going to be tempted to start making hypothesis or guesses in this step as it is human nature to simultainisuly make a guess at the cause while you observe. For example you might say when I click this button the function runs and gets the info but won't display the data. Now its possible that this could be an observation but often I will see students click buttons and just assume it runs the function they want. Keep the observation to, when I click this button the desired result is not what I want. To give another car example your horn may not work, so you might say to your self, "the horn wont work because the electrical system is broken." Now im not saying that your initial thought as to why the problem exists are wrong, but often what happens is you will blind yourself to other possibilities. You don't want to loose sight of what the problem you are trying to solve is, (the horn not working) by being fixated on something that may not be the cause of the problem.

To summarize, the observation step should look something like this, "My code is not working as intended. When I click this button it doesn't do the action I expect. It never works, and the error pops up immediately when I click it." It is important not to loose sight of what the problem is, with what you think the problem is caused by, thats the next step.
