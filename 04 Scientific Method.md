# Scientific Methodd

## Intro

When you start learning to program it is something that feels so foreign and alien to the average person. It's hard to put your finger on what exactly feels so off about it or why it so hard to learn and make improvements on. I would like to talk about the pitfalls and misunderstandings about programing to try and help you bridge the gap from where you are now and where you want to be. You probably wont fully understand all of what this topic is going over the first time but if you reread this I am hoping you can pick up more and more as your understanding continues to grow.

First I want to talk about what Scientific really means. When you hear science, or a science experiment you may initially think about things like the TV show Bill Nye the Science guy. The whole premise of that show is to show you scientific experiments or things that relate to science. I would like to challenge that none of those things are even remotely scientific. To be considered a scientist is someone who makes observations about the world around them, and then performs experiments to test their observations. I left that intentionally vague and broad for a few reasons. You can take a scientific approach to literally any topic. The whole point of being scientific is to learn new things and to fix problems. Before I can really prove or show what I mean by this I want to first talk about what the steps of the scientific method are.

<pre>
1: Make Observe
2: Form a Hypothesis
3: Construct a test to prove hypothesis
4: Run the experiment
5: Analyse the results
6: Form Conclusion
</pre>

I want to break down each one of these steps and how exactly they apply to coding. But to help make the point about how important these steps are to life and problem solving and that they don't just apply to coding I will also talk about how these apply to fixing a car, just to keep with the theme from earlier. Again I want to stress that scientific method is not something just for "scientist" and I would argue it is more of a way of life and a pattern of thinking. By making this your formal practice of problem solving you will have the framework to approach any problem.

### Observation

The first step in the process can come up at any point while you are working. Making an observation can be as easy as noticing, that there is a problem with your project. In the world of cars you might notice or observe that your car make an odd sound while you are driving. By noticing something like that you have unknowingly started the scientific process but a lot of people will stop the process at this point and ignore what solving the problem for themselves. Its a bit interesting to say, choose to engage withe observation but I often see students who are so accustomed to making the observation then having others fix the problem that they probably don't even realize they do it, or see it as a potential problem. So with any observation that leads you to want to fix something, you either recognize it as actionable or, as something you can delegate.

Possible the most detrimental mindset to the scientific method is when people think of them selves as "not smart enough" to solve their own problems. This destroys the problem solving process. If you ever find yourself thinking or saying phrases like these then I beg you remove those from your vocabulary and think about what you are saying.

<pre>
"I could never figure that out."
"Thats too complicated for me."
"Thats for smart people."
"Thats too hard."
</pre>

I have come across a lot of students who seem to take pride the fact that they are "Stupid" and that they couldn't solve the problem. So they are smart enough to notice a problem but not determined enough to solve it. Notice how I used the word determined there, thats what it takes. I really don't like the word smart for this exact reason. I feel like everyone uses the word "smart" super wrong or in the wrong context. They use it to describe someone that is not them. They typically use the word smart when what they really mean is "Knowledgeable." If I told you how exactly the inners of a computer worked you might think, "Wow this guy is smart." But in reality all I did was recite information you could have found in a text book. If anything what I have is great retention of knowledge but that doesn't make me "Smart." To me a smart person is someone who can solve problems in a specific field.

I may be smart in computers, but I am terrible not smart in the world of politics. I am also making a distinction that you can be smart in in specific fields, and that is for no other reason than I have chosen to engage in the observations I have made there. I am not predisposed to being smart with computers, its just something I have worked hard at and have recognized patterns inside of it. If I choose to be I know I could be smart in any field I put my mind to, as long as I put in the effort to follow up on the observations I made.

If you choose to engage in your observation then the next step is to do your best to notice everything you can about your observations.
in your observation you may not have experience at making specific acute observations when you begin, as you are new and not even sure what to observe. This skill will come with time as you choose to continue to engage in your observations.

When it comes to observations I would argue there are two kinds of observation modes, active and passive. Active observation is like when someone asks for your opinion on their artwork. You have chosen to engage specifically and you are going to notice things you wouldn't have otherwise because you are actively looking for things to notice. Your friend might also pitch in and draw your attention to a few things you couldn't possible have noticed because you have never painted before. They could tell you about the brush strokes that were used, and the different details that are hard to achieve. By having those things brought to you attention then your passive perception or observation is going to be more acute.Now that you know what to pay attention to you are bound to notice more things in the world of paintings. It is this skill that makes critiques good at what they do, they have enough power of observation in their given filed that they notice things that others who may not be familiar with the field would not, and they can draw your attention to it.

Lets talk a little about what I meant when I said making acute observations. Earlier I gave an example that your car could be making an odd noise. First even noticing there is a new sound implies that you make enough observations, weather they be passive or active, to notice your car is not acting how it normally does would be a great sign. does it happen all the time? Only when you turn? only at high speeds? Spending as much time as you can bear in the observation step is going to help you so much in the long run. It will ensure that you get as much of a full picture as to what is going on so when you move to the hypothesis step it can be as specific as possible.

In computer speak the types of observations you could have made is that your code failed after you added in a new feature. But where exactly did it fail? Did it fail on load? when you moved the mouse over an element, or when you clicked something. Did it happen immediately or was there a delay? I will talk more about taking this process slowly in another section but you need to train yourself to notice exactly the order of events that happen. Often I see students perform 10 actions and they are unsure of what caused the issue because they are not asking themselves these kind of questions, or moving methodically through their application and watching the error log after every single action.

You need to train yourself to specifically turn on your active observation when you see any sort of error or problem in your code. By making a habit out of this you passive observation skills will improve and you will start to know what is important when observing and what can be ignored. It is this process that most people don't understand when it comes to learning a new thing. When you start, you don't even know where to look or what to think, but over time you will be able to make better observations and isolate the problem and figure things out faster and faster.

The greatest part about coding is you can get amazingly specific feedback. I often use this phrase with my students, "I don't know what is going on, but lets make it tell us the answer." In theory its simple but in practice it can be rather difficult to start. In every programming language I am aware of you can print information to some sort of terminal or console. You can literally ask the computer about any value you have and what exactly it is a specific time.

When I was teaching myself some coding I used that tool a ridiculous amount of times. My programs were absolutely littered with them and my error log was near impossible to read and interpret after about 10 of those in my code. But what I was trying to do was gather as much information as I could get my hands on. I didn't know what was important so to me, everything was important until I could prove otherwise. Basically I was a detective in a crime scene, and I knew the answer to the crime was there I just needed to drive to find it.

That reminds me of an anecdote I have come across in the programming world that goes something like this, "Being a programmer is like being a detective solving a case where you are also the criminal/" The program doesn't work, and there is a 99% chance it was your fault, and now you have to figure out what you did to cause the problem. A good detective knows no detail is to small or insignificant. Its just up to you to spend the time to look over every detail.

I often see students hesitant to even give this process a try, and I come over and they have not used a single tool to try and figure out what is going on. I think they feel so overwhelmed with every thing going in their code and they just feel lost and like they don't even know where to start. In that case run your languages console.log command on literally every line and go through the scientific method for every line of code. That may seem drastic or excessive but the thing about coding is that it is always made up of tons of small parts, the chances are there is a step in there that confuses you. If you can't look at a line of code with pretty good confidence then that is where you need to start you observations. say, "I don't think that line of code does what I think" and start there.

You are going to be tempted to start making hypothesis or guesses in this step as it is human nature to simultainisuly make a guess at the cause while you observe. For example you might say when I click this button the function runs and gets the info but won't display the data. Now its possible that this could be an observation but often I will see students click buttons and just assume it runs the function they want. Keep the observation to, when I click this button the desired result is not what I want. To give another car example your horn may not work, so you might say to your self, "the horn wont work because the electrical system is broken." Now im not saying that your initial thought as to why the problem exists are wrong, but often what happens is you will blind yourself to other possibilities. You don't want to loose sight of what the problem you are trying to solve is, (the horn not working) by being fixated on something that may not be the cause of the problem.

To summarize, the observation step should look something like this, "My code is not working as intended. When I click this button it doesn't do the action I expect. It never works, and the error pops up immediately when I click it." It is important not to loose sight of what the problem is, with what you think the problem is caused by, thats the next step.
