# Programming is a language

It may seem odd at first that we refer programing as a “Language,” but that is truly the best way to look at it. You are learning to communicate in an entirely new way, and I mean that very literally. But thinking about that in the traditional sense can still give the wrong impression of what I mean by saying new ‘language.’ When we learn a new spoken language one of the first things that you need to learn is that you can not translate things 'word for word', instead you must learn to translate 'meaning for meaning'. A great example of this idea is saying ‘Thank you’ in spanish. In spanish you say ‘de nada,’ which literally translates into ‘of nothing.’ Now 'of nothing' techcically has meaning in english but it really doesn't communicate the same thing at all. Instead we must realize that we are translating the idea of gratitude, or thanks. This is what is meant by saying you must translate things meaning for meaning. Without an understanding of the culture and what the cultural phrases mean, translation would be impossible.

We see a similar issue in programming because the tasks we ask the computer to perform are technically using english words but the context of them are different and you can't do a direct translation. You need to read the code through a filter and translate what the code actually says into how a human would process it. So that means what would be a better way to say what you do is a computer translator. You are translating ideas that you have into a new language that the computer will understand. You have to learn the computers thought patterns and translate it from your brain to the computers 'brain.'


<!-- Another phenomenon that occurs when you are learning a new langage is there are also words in other languages that english really does not have words or concepts for. For example the word ‘Sobremesa‘ is a spanish word that translates to, ‘the conversation that follows a meal.’ Now it’s not hard to translate the word but we have to many words to describe what they have in one word. -->

Also like learning a new language the first few steps of learning to program covers the words you will use and what they mean. Then when you know words you can move onto forming them into a sentence and how their sentence structure is different than the one you are used to. This is referred to as the grammar of the language. In coding we refer to the grammar of the language as the syntax, but they are practically the same thing.

In english we structure our ideas in a specific way because that is how we have decided english should be spoken. But in other languages the structure of the sentence may be completely different. This makes speaking in the new language very difficult because not only are you having to worry about what does this word convey in the new language but where does this word fit in this sentence? For a sentence to make sense to the listener the words need to come in a specific order. *(come up with examples of this later).* Once you considering this it becomes apparent very quickly that learning to speak a new language requires more than just finding the equivalent word in the new language. You must learn to boil down the idea of what you are trying to convey/communicate and find a whole new sentence structure and the proper words to use. If you were to try and speak japanese using only literal translations it would make no sense to a native Japanese speaker.

When you are practicing your new language skills you are bound to make many mistakes in both pronunciation and grammar, but the saving grace about this is that we can usually rely on the listener to use enough reasoning, context and mastery of the language to figure out what is attempting to be communicated. Imagine if someone approached you and spoke with a very thick accent they said, “bathroom” you would know exactly what they were really asking. Can you show me where the nearest bathroom is. The only way you would be confused was if his accent we so thick you couldn’t even make out the word.

As humans we rely and live off of others ability to infer, guess, use context, and fill in the blanks from the information we were provided. When you really stop and think about it, it is almost like a super power. Within a few words we can pull so much meaning and understanding from our years of life experience. You probably don’t even realize that you do it. If you think about having a conversation with a child they ask so many questions about everything you say. Without even realizing it they are trying to build a working model of reality that can fill in holes and an understanding about the world they live in. It is from this young age that we start to shortcut our brains. If we had to process every word, one at a time and then put all those words into a sentence, then consider the meaning of the whole, then compare that to the situation that were in conversations would take forever. We spend our entire childhood building these ‘conversation shortcuts,’ and by the time we have reached maturity our ability to communicate and make leaps in meaning is engrained we literally don’t even realize we are doing it, more on that later.

## Phrases Make no sense

Cut to computer programming. Every idea and concept above that we just talked about, forget all of it. Regress your brain back to a 4 year old and re learn how to communicate because this is what it is going to take. A Computer requires communicating with a level of precision and clarity that we as humans have never had to deal with. Yes I mean communicating quite literally here, we are having a conversation with a computer asking it to perform a task or go give us feedback/information but one wrong miss step and we will get nothing but a broken program. This is so frustrating that it drives most new programmers to a level of annoyance and anger they have never known before. You might have thought of yourself as a good communicator and someone who can speak clearly but you probably never considered how much you rely on unspoken or inferred communication, and it is that mind set that will the biggest hurdle to learning to program.

Let’s go over an example to show what I am talking about. Growing up we tell kids to “Not to get into cars with strangers if they offer you candy.” Sound familiar? I want you to think of all the loopholes or situations you didn’t cover that exist with that statement, go ahead, I’ll wait.

First we have loosley explained what a stranger means We hope the kid understand that means anyone you don’t know. But even still think about times when when it ok to get in a car with someone you don’t know, what about police officers? Firefighters? Lets take it even further, lets define the word “know.” To know someone is for you personally to be acquainted with them beforehand. So I may know the person picking up my child but since they don’t know them the kid shouldn’t get in the car with them. Ok also lets define car. Do we just mean sedans? Trucks? Vans? Does getting the the bed of a track count as “getting in?“ What exactly does “get in with” mean. What about specifically “get in with” mean, if they get in at separate times is that ok? What if they offer the kid any other food? What does the kid define as “Candy”. I could literally write a whole novel to explain all the rules and exceptions to that exact situation, but to do so would feel worthless and un necessary. It would go on for hundreds of pages, taking time to define every word and their meaning in that context.

This is what I see as the first major hurdle for when learning to program. Often what we say has no bearing on what we mean. When we say, “do Not get into cars with strangers if they offer you candy” what we really are trying to say is, “I don’t want to lose you and have you get kidnapped. So please don’t be stupid” As you go forward in life you may want to start asking yourself, how would a smart alec kid try and poke holes in my rules. That is literally what we are working with when it comes to computer, an annoying kid who will find every hole in your logic.

## Error Handling

Another issue we encounter is the issue of context and “Error Handling” in a conversation. Let me give a few examples to illustrate what I mean. If we were standing in a room full of people and I were to ask “what is his name?” you would ask a clarifying questions “who?” From there I would clarify what I mean by “his” and you would be able to repeat the original question to yourself and give an appropriate answer and then we could continue our conversation without a problem. This is a perfect example of “Error Handling” while talking, but it can be done on the fly and not stop the conversation. You are so accustomed to this idea of on the fly clarification you don’t even realize how amazing of a tool it really is.
If I were to ask a computer the same question the conversation would a little like this.

<pre>Me: what is his name?
Computer: his?
Me: *points to guy* yeah him.
Computer: what about him?
Me: That guy, whats his name…
Computer: what guy?
Me: *points* THAT GUY! What is his name!?
Computer: Jerry</pre>

This may seem like an over exaggeration but it really isn’t. The issue that we ran into is that it wasn’t until the last statement that I did both, clarify who the subject of the question was and ask the question at the same time. The problem we have here is that the computer has no memory of past questions and needs needs us to be explicit all at the same time. Without all necessary info at the time to the inquiry it is seen as invalid and then it promptly forgets the question was even asked. Computers are are typically devoid of context or if it has a system of context build in it usually does not line up with what you think the context should be. In programming we often have to explicitly set the context so the program knows what values or variables we are trying to reference.

If you are not accustomed to this kind of blunt response it can feel jarring as the “conversation” just abruptly ended with a program failing error, and if you are not accustomed to reading errors it can feel like the computer is giving you no indication of what went wrong, or some weird cryptic response if you do read the error. It is 100% on you to recognize that your statement or question is unclear and needs clarifying, but identifying why your statement was poor can be hard. As a human we can get a correction in grammar and an answer at the same time. You have probably had the situation where you misspoke or used a wrong name and the person you are talking to will use the context of the situation and go off what you mean, not what you are saying. They may even correct you quickly, or ask for clarification like, “you mean Jill right? She is over there.”

The computer however will give you no such leeway, no clarification, and no on the fly correction. In computer programming we refer to the grammar of programming as syntax, and with improper syntax no communication can be had, unlike with humans where we can get the gist of what is being said.
