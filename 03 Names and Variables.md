## Names and Variables

To make things even more difficult there is a huge disconnect between the definition of the words on the screen are and their values, or what they represent. That statement was a confusing and vague so let's dig into what is meant. If I create a variable called age, we as a human we have such a connection to the meaning and definition of what age means it can be near impossible to see that word as anything else. There is however no promise or assurance that the variable age even holds a number inside of it. As the computer understands it, it is just a random assortment of characters that has no meaning. New programmers often make this assumption and association, often without even realizing it, that the letters ‘a’ ‘g’ and ‘e’ being arranged in that order is something that has meaning to the computer, but it does not. By giving something a name it is only natural for us to assume that the value inside of the variable matches what the name is but that is nowhere near the truth.

Having the value inside the variable line up with the definition is only true if we are consistent as a programer and make it make it that way. The computer does not care what we call anything, it is going to execute our instructions exactly as instructed, even if the instructions don’t make “sense”. Computers are devoid of “sense” so it falls to us to decide what “sense” means. On top of all that we have so much pre-existing biases towards words and the meaning associated to them that we have a hard time reading and understanding ‘age’ as anything other than the definition. To the computer the variable ‘age’ is literally just a random collection of characters and the order of them has no meaning and it won’t check your value against the name of the variable to see if it ‘makes sense’. That connection is only meaningful to the programmer. Learning to mentally disconnect that the words we see have no bearing on the value tied the variable name we choose to use. Age could just as easily store a paragraph of text, or a list of all the countries capitals in europe.

So then why give variables names that mean anything? Why not just slap the keyboard every time we make a variable and just use the random assortment of characters that come out. Because it is necessary to name them. But wait I hear you yelling at me through the pages, didn’t you literally just spend the last page saying the names are meaningless. Yes, I did. But the necessity is not for the computer, it is for the programmer. We write code the way we do not for the computer, but for ourselves and the other programers who will read our code. With that understanding then you will start to realize that we are literally having a conversation with 4 people all at the same time, one: the computer, two: our current self, three: our future self, four: other programmers.

It may seem odd at first glance to include ourselves on that list twice but any programmer who has ever gone back to an old project knows that that code can be as foreign to them as someone’ elses code. A fun anecdote to illustrate my point is this programming joke, “When I wrote this code only god and I knew what it did. Now only god knows.” There is a phrase that pops up in programming called, “mind mapping” and it happens when the programmer is quickly making variable names that don’t communicate what the value should be. Examples of this is naming variables things like, ‘x’ or ‘value’ or ‘things’. The problem with naming variables this way is that it is extremely unclear what you are attempting to do in your given code block. If you are having a hard time following your code now, then there is no way in hell you will be able to quickly decipher it after a weekend.

You are also writing code in such a way to communicate with other programmers. There is another anecdote is, “Write your code with the assumption that the next guy to maintain it an ax murder who knows where you live.” This may seem like an over exaggeration but it can be one of the most frustrating experiences trying to reason about someone else's code if the names of things don’t make any sense. In this situation you are literally trying to enter into the mind of other human and trying to reason about their problem solving approach. Really at the end of the day a big reason we have “coding best practices” is to make our code readable to other programmers.

We are literally making our own language with new definitions for every word as write our code, in my program people can be one thing, but in another way it can be completely different.

Every word we see in a program must learn to be looked at with skepticism because we can never be absolutely certain that the words we see are relate to the value tied to the name of the variable. So we have this dissonance that the names of things are both widely important and meaningless at the same time. Most of the reasons why we write programs the way we do has nothing to do the way a computer thinks or works, but it does have meaning for the other programmers  who will read and try in interpret meaning from your code. So we are trying to simultaneously communicate to two different people or ‘Beings” at the same time, one a human, and the other a computer; and both will interpret your code differently. A human sees meaning in the code, we do this because it means we can get this end result, the computer make no such connection and it lifelessly follows the instructions one step at a time with no concept of what came before and what will come next or the meaning it provides the user. There is this dissonance between the words we the programmers choose to represent meaning and the computers total ignorance what the what the words mean, because it doesn’t even have the concept of words, only a collection of characters.
